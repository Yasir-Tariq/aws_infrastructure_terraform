# Terraform-VPC
Provisioning AWS Virtual Private Cloud and compute resources along with other necessary resources using Terraform.


## Version
    Terraform v0.12.18
    provider.aws v2.47.0



## Child Modules
    This repository consists of five child modules which are as follows:
      1.alb_tg: contains an application load balancer and a target group.
      2.asg-lc: contains an autoscaling group and a launch configuration.
      3.ec2:    contains an EC2 instance.
      4.iam:    contains a role for s3 access along with a policy and an instance_profile.
      5.vpc:    contains a vpc along with other related resources.
    Also,there is directory named "templates" which contains userdata files used in the scenario.

## Parent Modules
    This repository consists of three parent modules which are as follows:
      1.base_infra: represents the independent infrastructure(vpc).
      2.compute:    represents compute resources such as ec2,alb,asg etc.
      3.iam:        represents iam role and policy.
    base_infra and iam are independent modules where as compute module is dependent on both other
    modules. So, keep the sequence in mind.

## Explanation
    Infrastructure is all parametrised based on user values which can be stored in a tfvars file.
    Public subnets are created dynamically based on the number of availability zones provided by
    the user. Terraform state is maintained in a s3 bucket. All the parent modules have their own
    separate Terraform state files. Moreover, a Dynamodb could be provisioned before hand to ensure
    state locking, which means that only one user is allowed at a time to access the state to avoid
    conflict. All the code is in accordance with selected Terraform workspace so that we can have two
    or more setups with multiple workspaces. Outputs are exported and are used in the form of locals
    specifically in the compute's main.tf file. Moreover, two terraform_remote_state data resources
    are defined to fetch the network and iam state from the s3 bucket.
